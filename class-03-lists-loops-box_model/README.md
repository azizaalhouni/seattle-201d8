## **Code Review**

Let's take about 30 minutes to do our first code review session. We're going to look at someone's code, have students read through it and explain it, take questions, and so on. Code review is an important part of professional development processes and also a key part of our learning environment in this course.

## Learning Journal

You should already have a `learning_journal` directory in your `~codefellows/201/` directory. Let's talk about what goes in it, add a first file to it, create a place for it to live on GitHub, and then get it wired up on GitHub.

## Git Branches & Lab Prep

[Slides on using branches in Git](slides/git-branching.pdf)

We're going to go over the use of branches in Git and how that integrates into workflow. Up to this point we've been doing everything in the master branch, but from this day forward, you should generally never work in master on your own laptop except in specific use cases.
